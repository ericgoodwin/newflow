= Newflow

Newflow lets you decorate ruby classes with workflows. It also has a cool .dot generation tool for visualizing your workflows. 

= Usage

  class OfficeWorker
    def define_workflow
      state :start do
        transitions_to :sleeping_under_desk, :unless => :boss_is_there?
        transitions_to :answering_phones, :if => :boss_is_there?
      end

      state :sleeping_under_desk do
        transitions_to :answering_phones, :if => :phones_are_ringing?
      end

      state :answering_phones do
        transitions_to :going_home, :if => :after_five?, :trigger => :shutdown_computer
      end

      state :going_home, :stop => true
    end

    def boss_is_there?
      boss.at_work?
    end

    def phones_are_ringing?
      phones.detect { |p| p.ringing? }
    end

    def after_five?
      Time.now.hour >= 17
    end

    def shutdown_computer
      `shutdown -h now`
    end
  end

= Caveats

None of the code is in this project yet, so yea... the above doesn't *actually* work. Get ready though, it's gonna be awesome!
